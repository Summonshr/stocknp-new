People often base their decision of investment on how the company is doing in current scenario. Their reserve, Earning per share, Book value etc plays keep important in making decision. And it's a good thing. Most of the people follow this strategy and most of them are happy with it and to be honest, it is safest way to manage your portfolio.

But things could go wrong. What about Nepal Investment bank on latest trend? The whole market is rallying bullishly but this one is not picking up the pace. 

Even though the company has massive reserve, good earning per share and book value, the company's stock is not preferred in market. What could be the reason?

The first thing would be the constant negative news that is entering the market. The recent controversies regarding real estate loan,   degrading performance each quarter are some of them. These have triggered massive supply of stock on the market that it is not being absorbed well.

Secondly, it is not picking up pace or to be exact is not able to. While other banks have gone far with partnering with new technologies and opening more branches, NIB is not doing much here.

So, apart from key ratios, I believe it is vital to watch on company's behavior on how it is evolving. As companies are distributing bonus share, it is diluting the value per share. In these scenarios, if the company does not make more profit than what they have given as dividend, the stock of company is likely to suffer.
