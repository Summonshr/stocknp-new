**Demat Account:** It is a account that holds your share. That means, when you buy shares, it gets credited to this account. You can open your demat account at various capitals. In General practice, you can have at most two demat account. Think of it like a bank's saving's account but for your stock.

**Capital:** Capital is a subsidiary company run by bank or broker or a single entity of itself which provides you the demat services. Demat service costs Rs. 150 per year. Many of the capital provide services free of charge for first year. Visit any of the nearest branch to open a demat account.

For example: how much you have got, how much bonus were added or what is your total current value. Meroshare charges Rs. 50 per year. You can find websites [here](https://meroshare.cdsc.com.np). You can specify while opening demat account whether or not you want to take it. 

**Share or Stock**: Think of it as a part of the company which if you hold it, you become eligible to take the dividend from the profit it makes.

**Broker**: A licensed party that has the right to trade shares and exchange payment on your behalf. Most of these brokers can be easily found around Anamnagar and New Baneshwor areas. They charge you 0.6% or less of the total amount as commission for trading on your behalf.
