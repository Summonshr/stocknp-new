People often base their decision of investment on how the company is doing in current scenario. Their reserve, Earning per share, Book value etc plays keep important in making decision. And it's a good thing. Most of the people follow this strategy and most of them are happy with it and to be honest, it is safest way to manage your portfolio.

But things could go wrong. What about Nepal Investment bank on latest trend? The whole market is rallying bullishly but this one is not picking up the pace. 

Even though the company has massive reserve, good earning per share and book value, the company's stock is not preferred in market. What could be the reason?

The first thing would be the constant negative news that is entering the market. The recent controversies regarding real estate loan,   degrading performance each quarter are some of them. These have triggered massive supply of stock on the market that it is not being absorbed well.

Secondly, it is not picking up pace or to be exact is not able to. While other banks have gone far with partnering with new technologies and opening more branches, NIB is not doing much here.

As company is distributing bonus share year after year, it is diluting it's value per share. If earning per share decreases consistently over time, investors will loose interest in those stock. 

So, apart from key ratios, it is vital to watch on company's behavior on how it is evolving. 

1. Are they doing enough to keep up with the competition?
2. Are they making positive headlines like branch openings, new attractive schemes or aggressive advertisements?
3. Are they spending enough on training their employees?
4. Are their future plan clear enough?

Using above points, no one should be surprised that NIB share prices fell to the current state. 

Further more, using same points, we can say why BPCL stock are being preferred by investors even though majority of its fixed deposits has been invested upon new companies. Investors believe that it will yield good return in near future.
